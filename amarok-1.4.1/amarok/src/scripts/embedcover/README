<b>About:</b><br>
EmbedCover is a script for embedding album cover images in MP3 files. The script will
automatically look up the image associated to it in amaroK and embed this image in the file.
</p>
<p>
The MP3 file must have an ID3-V2 tag, otherwise the script will abort, and the file must be
in your Collection.
</p>
<p>
It is recommended that you <i>back up</i> your MP3 file before using this script on it. Although the
script is designed not to harm your file, the operation is not reversible and should therefore
be used with caution.
</p>

<p>
<b>Usage:</b><br>
Select a track in the playlist, then start EmbedCover from the context-menu (right mouse click).
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to use EmbedCover as a command line tool, by calling the "addimage2mp3.rb"
script contained in this package. Addimage2mp3 only requires Ruby to be installed, not amaroK.
The EmbedCover amaroK Script is a frontend for this tool.
